<h1>Library App</h1>
<p>This JS Library app features DOM manipulation using JS and inputed book tracker.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<h3>Keep Track of Your Books</h3>
<a href="https://oalva-rez.github.io/library-app/">Live version</a>
<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
<p>This project came after learning about ES6 Class syntax along with constructors. Originally I stored the user books input in an explicit object but after learning about constructors and prototyping methods I refactored the script to create an instance per every book submitted by the user. This book constructor holds methods that add the book to the DOM tree. Another substantial obstacle was configuring the CSS grid of book tiles to collapse accordingly to different screen dimensions. This gave me the opportunity to really understand the difference between auto-fit and auto-fill properties along with the minmax function.</p>

<p>If I were to revisit this project I would seperate the JavaScript DOM manipulation with the book entry mechanics. I would also start by storing the book entires to either a database or local storage</p>
